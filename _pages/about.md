Thanks for stopping by! :wave:

I am a PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. Guosheng Lin. I received my M.S. degree from the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, where I was advised by Prof. Nanyang Ye. My previous research primarily focused on out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization problems in traditional computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Currently, my research focuses on generative models, including images, videos, and 4D data.

<strong>Research interest: Computer vision, generative models, OoD generalization.</strong>
